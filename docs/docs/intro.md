# xLeap Intro

Let's discover **xLeap in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started with xLeap

LLMs have taken the world by storm. But they are still quite far away from adding value to end-user products. One of
the core challenges in using LLMs today is understanding when LLM fails to deliver its promise - loosely called as
hallucination. To mitigate hallucinations, you need to evaluate your LLM. However, LLM evaluation isn’t like evaluation
or analytics in the API-first world. There is no one true answer and you can’t measure performance quantifiably. Well
you can, but the metrics that are used are either non-interpretable by non-AI experts and/or have no correlation to the
actual performance of the model.

Imagine a scenario where a customer service chatbot, powered by an LLM, is interacting with a customer. The customer
says, "I'm upset because my order hasn't arrived yet." A contextually aware response would acknowledge the customer's
concern and provide information about the order status. However, a less sophisticated LLM might generate a generic or
irrelevant response, such as "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you like our products?"

In this scenario, traditional evaluation metrics might rate both responses as acceptable since they syntactically fit
the conversational flow. However, the first response is more appropriate and helpful from a customer service
perspective.

The future lies in developing new kinds of evaluation tools for LLMs. These tools should be:

- Understandable: Clear and simple enough for everyone, not just experts.
- Task-specific: Knowing which metrics for what type of tasks should be tracked.
- Reliable: Providing a true reflection of how well the model works in different situations.

PS: This is what our mission is at **[xLeap ai](https://xleaplabs.com)**. We’re building a collaborative suite for
software devs and product managers of the world to ensure that they can accurately measure the LLMs performance and
take LLM to their end-users.
